Golang clean code example with unit testing

Based on `https://github.com/CaptainCodeman/clean-go`

I added some additional providers for sqlite and memory storage, plus I added unit testing. I am using this a a learning project for golang so my approaches may not be the best practice for idiomatic Go. I would love any feedback or suggestions.
